### Purpose of the project:

Manhattan coffee House is a [DevMedia](https://www.devmedia.com.br/) course project, where your challenge is to create a website for a fictitious coffee shop. It is worth remembering that in this project it was not necessary to create the responsive part and use a JS tool, I did it by my own choice, to challenge myself and learn more about it.
